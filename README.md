## What's in there?

My config for my Development Environment.
I am using:

* Neovim
* zsh &rarr [config web](https://thevaluable.dev/zsh-install-configure/)

## WARNING

There are no backup system. If you install this on top of your dotfiles, expect a big mess.
You shouldn't use the `install.sh` script. You should only pick whatever you want and include it in your own config.
